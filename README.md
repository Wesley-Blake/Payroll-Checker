# Payroll_Checker

This is a package (init file soon to be) that helps me run payroll by checking for common errors and sending reminder emails.

# helpers package

This is simple functions I use to reduce the visual complexity on main.py

# not_started

First module to find errors. It takes 1 dataframe from helpers.data to return a dict of manager_emails: employee_email_list.
