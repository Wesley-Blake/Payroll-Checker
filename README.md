# Payroll-Checker
I use this to check paryoll for basic things.

## Helpers Package
1. Basic functions to read data, get pay period number, and email.

## Not Started
1. Simply checks for people that haven't started their timesheet.
2. Will return a dict of KEY: manager_email and VALUE: employee_emails list.
